# Página de las Manos

[Cueva de las Manos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cueva_de_las_Manos) is a cave in Argentina that is decorated with hundreds of prehistoric hand imprints.

The image of the cave left a deep impression on me. I found it to be an eerie and moving monument to the human impulse to assert one's presence, and I wondered what a digital representation for this would be like.

Página de las Manos is a web page that lets visitors make their mark. Clicking on the page will place a hand print in a random color on the canvas. If multiple people are placing prints at the same time everyone will see hand prints appear in real time.
